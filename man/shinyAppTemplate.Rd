\description{
This function populates a directory with files for a Shiny application. They
are based off of the "12_counter" example which can be run with
\code{runExample()}.
}
\details{
The example application includes the following files and directories:\preformatted{appdir/
├── app.R
├── R
│   └── counter-module.R
└── tests
    ├── integration.R
    ├── integration
    │   └── test-counter.R
    ├── shinytest.R
    ├── shinytest
    │   └── mytest.R
    ├── testthat.R
    └── testthat
        ├── helper-load.R
        └── test-counter.R
}

Some notes about these files:
\itemize{
\item app.R is the main application file.
\item All files in the R/ subdirectory are automatically sourced when the
application is run.
\item The R/counter-module.R file is automatically sourced when the application
is run. This file contains code for a \href{moduleServer()}{Shiny module} which
is used in the application.
\item The tests/ directory contains various tests for the application. You may
choose to use or remove any of them. They can be executed by the
\code{\link[=runTests]{runTests()}} function.
\item tests/integration.R is a test runner for test files in the
tests/integration/ directory.
\item tests/integration/test-counter.R is a test for the counter module.
\item tests/shinytest.R is a test runner for test files in the
tests/shinytest/ directory.
\item tests/shinytest/mytest.R is a test that uses the
\href{https://rstudio.github.io/shinytest/}{shinytest} package to do
snapshot-based testing.
\item tests/testthat.R is a test runner for test files in the
tests/testthat/ directory.
\item tests/testthat/test-counter.R is a set of tests that use the
\href{https://testthat.r-lib.org/}{testthat} package for testing.
\item tests/testthat/helper-load.R is a helper script that is automatically
loaded before running test-counter.R. (This is performed by the testthat
package.)
